```
oc login --token=<TOKEN> --server=https://api.<CLUSTER_NAME>.s1.devshift.org:6443
```

2. RHOAM is installed
3. SSO IDP configured on a cluster

## Steps

1. Run the following command and log in as a `customer-admin` user using testing-idp

```

2. Verify the "3Scale Api Rate Limiting" dashboard is present and shows some data
